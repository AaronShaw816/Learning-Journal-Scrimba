            <h3>How I stay committed to learning</h3>
            <p>I consider myself a lifelong learner. During my time as a plumber, I faced new challenges every day, and it was incredibly rewarding to find solutions to them.</p>
            <p>I remain dedicated to learning by minimizing distractions and enjoying the process of solving problems and discovering new concepts.</p>
            <h3>Why journal?</h3>
            <p>Journaling holds immense value for a variety of reasons. It serves as a powerful tool for tracking your learning progress, allowing you to see how far youâ€™ve come and identify areas for improvement. Additionally, journaling acts as a personal reminder that you have the resilience and capability to overcome future challenges. </p>
            <p>By reflecting on past experiences and achievements, you can build confidence and maintain a positive mindset, even when facing new struggles. This practice not only enhances self-awareness but also fosters a sense of accomplishment and motivation to keep moving forward.</p>

                <p>I'm glad to have been studying with Scrimba. It's interactive coding sessions are so helpful to learn new concepts through seeing someone show me and practicing on my own afterwards.</p>

                <p>For a long time, I have wanted to make a career change into tech. I am so glad that I am working so hard to achieve this goal, but it can be so scary to start learning something from scratch.</p>

                <p>Fear often accompanies learning, but facing it head-on can transform challenges into opportunities. Embracing fear as part of the journey fosters growth, resilience, and a deeper understanding of new skills.</p>
